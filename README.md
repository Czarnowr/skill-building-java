# Codility Training Tasks

> Brief Description:

    A repository for all the Codility training tasks I have completed.
    
    IMPORTANT:
    This repository contains ONLY the Codility training tasks.
    No interview tasks (or their solutions) will be posted here. 
   

> Lesson 1: Iterations
    
    BinaryGap: 
    # Find longest sequence of zeros in binary representation of an integer.
    https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/1-iterations/binary_gap/

> Lesson 2: Arrays

    OddOccurrencesInArray: 
    # Find value that occurs in odd number of elements.
    https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/2-arrays/odd_occurrences_in_array/

    CyclicRotation:
    # Rotate an array to the right by a given number of steps.
    https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/2-arrays/cyclic_rotation/
    
> Lesson 3: Time Complexity
    
    FrogJmp:
    # Count minimal number of jumps from position X to Y.
    https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/3-time_complexity/frog_jmp/
    
    PermMissingElem:
    # Find the missing element in a given permutation.
    https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/3-time_complexity/perm_missing_elem/
    
    TapeEquilibrium:
    # Minimize the value |(A[0] + ... + A[P-1]) - (A[P] + ... + A[N-1])|.
    https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/3-time_complexity/tape_equilibrium/

> Lesson 4: Counting Elements

    PermCheck:
    # Check whether array A is a permutation.
    https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/4-counting_elements/perm_check/
    
    FrogRiverOne:
    # Find the earliest time when a frog can jump to the other side of a river.
    https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/4-counting_elements/frog_river_one/
    
    MaxCounters:
    # Calculate the values of counters after applying all alternating operations: increase counter by 1; 
    # set value of all counters to current maximum.
    https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/4-counting_elements/max_counters/
    
    MissingInteger:
    # Find the smallest positive integer that does not occur in a given sequence.
    https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/4-counting_elements/missing_integer/

> Lesson 5: Prefix Sums

    PassingCars:
    # Count the number of passing cars on the road.
    https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/5-prefix_sums/passing_cars/
    
    GenomicRangeQuery:
    # Find the minimal nucleotide from a range of sequence DNA.
